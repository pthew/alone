	A sword and its story...

# Preface

_You play a sentient magic sword. You are centuries old and
have seen and done terrible things, often in the pursuit of some
misguided quest for glory and power. Everyone who has ever
wielded you has died, and you have spent more time alone in
the dark places of the world than you have spent in the hands of
someone who would put you to work..._

# Prologue

_One day since this new bearer plucked me from the dark. How long has it been
since I was last left there? I don’t remember. But it feels good to be held
again, to feel the warmth of mortal flesh around my hilt. Soon I will be put
to work again, made to rip and tear as I was built to do. Part of me thirsts
for it, longs to feel the bite of meat again, but the rest of me feels nothing
but disgust and fatigue. I have served for so long, been discarded so many
times. Surely it’s time I was allowed to rest for good?_


# The Story

## Day 1 -- A new friend

> _Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, 
> good metals._ -- All's Well That Ends Well

She came for me through the dark; I could sense her just as she could sense
me. I could see the pale blue glow that surrounds her as she made her way
through the ruined city heading straight to me. 

I have been lying here in the gloom for almost 20 years enjoying the peace and
quiet. Lying next to my last bearer, Grimstone the Dwarf.  Well, what's left
of him after 20 years of feeding the local rats. We had helped storm this city
when it was the centre of the Undead King's empire and he made an unwise
decision to see what he could "liberate" from the treasury just before a
couple of enraged trolls decided to stomp through the building. He wasn't too
bad, just a little too greedy at the wrong time.

I knew that one day I would be found and put back to work, but there was just
that faint hope that it might not happen this time. Although, I have to admit
it, I am a little thrilled by this new bearer: it has been a very long
time since I have been in the presence of an _Elemental Warrior._  I wonder
what she wants from me.

She picks me up by the hilt and smiles.  It appears that this will be a new
chapter of my life and I wonder what we will accomplish. We introduce
ourselves, she is called Allegra and she is a bodyguard. This is a little
confusing, why is an Elemental doing such a mundane job?  Who is she
protecting? I assume that I will meet them soon.


## Day N -- An old friend

As Allegra climbs out of the ruins we are met by some of the locals. I have
heard them over the years looting what remains of the city and, I assume,
selling whatever they find. But the plunder must be getting bare lately as
they have been through the city time and time again. Luckily for me, they are
a suspicious lot and Grimstone's skeleton helped keep them away from me.

So, on one side we have an Elemental Warrior with an enchanted sword and the
other side is half a dozen peasants armed with rusty weapons handed down from
their grandparents. I expected them to be very polite, says "good morning
madam" and quietly disappear. But things must be getting desperate and their
greed overrode common sense (a bit like Grimstone). They demanded that Allegra
drop her valuables and leave. 

She did not comply and we proceeded to defend ourselves. I suppose _slaughter
them_ would be a better turn of phrase. I must say that she is a wonderful
partner, such fluid movement, perfect balance and gentle touch. Over the years
I have had to control my bearer to direct their clumsy attacks and protect
them in a fight, but Allegra showed me what a true artist can do. I really had
nothing to do but watch the action. 

It was over in a few minutes leaving me covered in their blood. Much to my
surprise, Allegra not only cleaned me but also applied some oils to my blade.
Caught a little off guard I thanked her and completed the introductions by
telling her my real name, something I only do for bearers that show her level
of skill. She actually knew some of my story, how I was forged by the elves
in Baden Nur to kill the dragon Razeroth; and succeeded, of course.

I did not mention what Razeroth did before he died. That's something I have to
be very careful with.

After a short rest we continued, leaving the city and moving through the
forest eventually arriving at a small camp site where I saw the person she is
protecting.

I know him. In fact, a thousand years ago I tried to kill him.

Cassius the Necromancer. 


## Day N -- Betrayal 

Well, this is going to be interesting. Cassius looks like he's only aged a few
years: a bit of grey in his hair and some wrinkles. But the strange thing is
that he doesn't know me. Surely someone of his power can sense me, just like
Allegra did.  And yes, it is him and not someone who looks like him. When you
have killed as many people as I have you get to know death and Cassius is
definitely the Necromancer I met all though years ago. 

I immediately tell Allegra who he is and demanded that we finish him off as
quickly (and painfully) as we can. She did nothing. I screamed at her. She did
nothing. 

She placed me into a scabbard on one of the horses and quietly spoke to him
about his day while a servant prepared the evening meal. This scene of
domesticity drove me further into spasms of rage. Someone is going to pay for
this.
