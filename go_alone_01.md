	A sword and its story...

# Preface

_You play a sentient magic sword. You are centuries old and
have seen and done terrible things, often in the pursuit of some
misguided quest for glory and power. Everyone who has ever
wielded you has died, and you have spent more time alone in
the dark places of the world than you have spent in the hands of
someone who would put you to work..._

# Prologue

_One day since this new bearer plucked me from the dark. How long has it been
since I was last left there? I don’t remember. But it feels good to be held
again, to feel the warmth of mortal flesh around my hilt. Soon I will be put
to work again, made to rip and tear as I was built to do. Part of me thirsts
for it, longs to feel the bite of meat again, but the rest of me feels nothing
but disgust and fatigue. I have served for so long, been discarded so many
times. Surely it’s time I was allowed to rest for good?_


# The Story

## Day 1 -- A fight and revelations

_Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death: Fainting, despair; despairing,
yield thy breath!_

I have destroyed kingdoms and help forge empires. Today I killed some
peasants. I tire of this game.

My new bearer is called **Manfred** and when he talks to his companions he is
sweet and innocent, but I sense something deep inside him. I think he yearns
for blood just like I use to. 

Our first fight together was just some stupid peasants that tried to rob
Manfred and his companions. I can still taste their fear as I led Manfred in
our new dance: To feel the flesh tear as I swept through a body and the
taste of their blood. How many times have I danced like this? The years in the
dark have not dulled my senses and powers.  One of the peasants, maybe a
blacksmith, came at us with a large hammer that may have have damaged me, but
I was able to alter Manfred's swing just enough to hit the handle instead of
the hammer's steel head.  They may think that they control me, but it is I who
controls the dance.

Afterwards, Manfred cleaned the blood off me and, much to my surprise, applied
scented oils. Someone has taught the boy some good habits. 


## Day N -- More fools

As Manfred and his companions rested and had dinner more peasants attacked us.
I suspect that they were out looking for their missing friends and found the
bodies. They had tracked us to our camp and decided, foolishly, to extract
some revenge. They were better organised than the rabble we first encountered.
They came at us using the "bulls horn" formation: the main body in the centre
and smaller detachments to the left and right. These "horns" will swing around
to envelope us. I have seen this strategy in play many times and managed to
alert Manfred to the situation.

Two of the peasants in the centre group fought well, much better that I
expected from a bunch of peasants. Perhaps they were old soldiers?  They
targeted Manfred immediately, clearly identifying him as the main danger to
the group. 

I think that they must have fought together in the past as their attacks were
well coordinated, with minimum communications. They had done this many times
before and old habits had reasserted themselves. As I watched the two fight in
such a coordinated way I started reminiscing about the twins and how they
fought using my sister and myself in a similar fashion. Centuries later,
Grondell had also welded us during his battles with the Undead King. Left and
right hands working in unison to carve out the dead heart of the King's
empire. In the final battle, she had been driven into the King's chest just
before he fell off the battlements; both of them disappearing forever.

While my mind wandered in the past, the soldiers managed to hit Manfred
several times. I has pulled out of my reminiscing by his blood flowing into my
hilt. The soldiers were good but their training made them predictable and
their age slowed them. With my mind finally focusing on the fight, Manfred and
I dispatched them quickly. They should have died of old age, but their
luck ran out today.


## Day N -- History and defeat

Manfred and his companions moved to a new camp to rest and treat their wounds.
The saying goes "idle hands makes the devils work" -- I could see one of the
group watching me as everyone else rested. His name is Falco. Was he
planning to steal me? 

I hope not. He was not what I would call hero-material.  If he did steal me,
then I would have to kill him and hope that someone better finds me.  I
have done this in the past to the bearers that I found to be unsuitable. Find a
weakness and exploit it. Whisper in the dark to feed their fears until 
madness takes over. Occasionally they use me to end their life - I don't care
so long as I am free of them.

As everyone rests, my thoughts return to yesterday's memories, especially my
sister - is she still alive or has she found peace? We were forged by the
Dwarves that live under the Kor-Gari Range to the North. We were given to the
twins in order to kill the daemon X (I cannot say his name as some part of him
still resides in me and I fear that saying his name may awaken him). I have
lost count of the number of battles we fought in, but somehow it is always the
one-on-one fights that I cherish, especially with my sister at my side,
singing songs of blood.

Damn it! What is happening to me? Again, while I was day dreaming of the past
I missed something: I did not see Falco approach. He grabbed me and ran into
the woods. 

Manfred pursued us and managed to catch up just as we entered into a rocky
grove. There was a brief struggle and Manfred wrestled me from Falco's
grasp. Falco then grabbed a stone and swung it at Manfred several times.
Manfred managed to dodge the first few but was hit by a glancing blow,
knocking him to the ground. As Falco approached us intent on finishing off
Manfred, I focused my power, took control of Manfred's arm and stuck Falco
through the stone, shattering it and Falco's chest. I could feel X stirring
and hoped that drawing some of his power did not wake him.

Today just gets better and better. The rock grove we find ourselves in belongs
to a troll. She is not happy with us disturbing her sleep and tries to crush
us with a nearby tree. Luckily, Manfred see sense and concludes that we cannot
defeat her while he is still injured. We make a hasty retreat, hoping that she
will find Falco delicious.


## Day N -- Dark places and more revenge

Manfred decided to rest again today. The fights over the last two days have
taken a toll and he just wants to rest and recover. 

The group huddle around the camp fire and tell stories. I half listen to their
boring adventures. If only I can tell them of my life and what I have
accomplished over the centuries. But, perhaps, their little minds may not be
able to handle my adventures!

When Manfred starts his story, he has my complete attention. It is always wise
to learn everything you can about the person who wields you.

They say bad luck comes in threes. And I say it has excellent timing. It
appears that I did not kill all of them.

A horse and rider crashed out of the woods straight at Manfred. The rider took
a swing at Manfred with a small mace, catching him clean on the side of his
head. The rest of the group just stood there dumbfounded as Manfred fell to
the ground with half of his scalp hanging loose.  The elf Adoel was the first
to react (she's an elf, what do you expect?) and even before the rider had cleared
the other side of the camp she has loosed half a dozen arrows, hitting the
rider in the back. He fell from the horse and lay still at the edge of the camp. 

Everyone finally started moving: Adoel and Aldaron went to Manfred's aide and
the others pounced on the fallen rider. He was too far gone to get much
information, but we did gather enough to know that he was part of the caravan
that Manfred tried to rob and had tracked Manfred over the last week.

We now have something in common. I have also been hunted by an enemy.


## Day N -- Recovery and reminiscing again

Manfred didn't die, I'm surprised. The wound looked far worse that it was and
the elves sewed his scalp back on and gave him some herbs to deal with the
pain and speed his recovery.  He'll have good scar to show off when it fully
heals.

Another day of doing nothing. Adoel had the rest of the group search the woods
around the camp to see if there was any more unwanted visitors, but it looks
clear. She did post guards just in case.

With nothing else to do (or kill) I drifted off into my past again. The sword
_Dragon’s Tooth_ had manipulated his owners for almost a hundred years,
convincing them that my current bearer was their mortal enemy so we would
fight. _Dragon’s Tooth_ did not know the source of my power and we bested him
time and time again. Like me, _Dragon’s Tooth_ had been forged to kill a monster. 

_Dragon’s Tooth's_ original bearer was a Knight called Sir Davvick. Davvick's
monster was a dragon (were you surprised?). I do not know the full details,
but I gathered the fight had been close and as Davvick had struck the fatal
blow the dragon had belched flame, killing Davvick and warping _Dragon’s
Tooth._ I suspect that this caused his hatred for me or, perhaps, it was
jealousy. I really don't know. Perhaps I should: we did have a relationship
that spanned a hundred years. Oh, does that mean he was my oldest
acquaintance? Definitely not a friend. Sorry, I'm rambling, back to the story.

Ironically, _Dragon’s Tooth_ was destroyed in the place I was forged all of
those years ago.  The dwarves had long disappeared from Kor-Gari and we fought
in the empty halls, the sounds echoing off the distant walls. We badly wounded
his owner, who turned and tried to flee over the bridge that spans one of lava
chasms. The wound was too much and he slipped in the dark, falling into the
lava. Just as I was born in the lava they died.

## Epilogue

_To die, to sleep - to sleep - perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub, for in
that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this
mortal coil, must give us pause_
